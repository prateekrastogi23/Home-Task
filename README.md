In this project, we utilized Jupyter Notebook and the Pandas library to analyze two TSV files containing tweets about Britney Spears, focusing on the larger 500MB file. Our first step involved ingesting and cleaning the data to ensure its usability for analysis. After preparing the dataset, we developed several query functions to extract meaningful insights. These functions enabled us to determine the number of tweets containing specific terms posted each day, identify unique users who tweeted, calculate average likes for those tweets, and analyze the geographical locations based on place IDs. Additionally, we examined the times of day when the tweets were posted and identified the user who contributed the most tweets related to the searched term, enhancing our understanding of Twitter engagement around Britney Spears.
